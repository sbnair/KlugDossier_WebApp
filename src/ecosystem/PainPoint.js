    <h2>Whatâ€™s the Pain Point?</h2>

    <p>Data Providers of different domains send raw, unprocessed and unfiltered data i.e. with no clear labels, unstructured formats, not refined etc.</p>

    <p>Data sent is not compatible for AI firms to apply machine learning models on top of data, hence unable to perform predictive analysis using AI.</p>

    <p>Lack of validation of data.</p>

    <p>Inability to consolidate data acquired from different sources.</p>

    <p>Constantly changing/fluctuating data.</p>

    <p>Lack of consistency in data resulting in the suffering of the Prediction Market.</p>
