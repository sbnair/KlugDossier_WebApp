    <h2>Ecosystem and Competitors</h2>

    <p>We donâ€™t have any direct competitors however there are a few projects which could develop something similar along the lines in the future. As of now some of the data projects could be used for our benefits and we can compliment each other by using each others protocols.</p>
    
 
    <h3>Ocean Protocol</h3>

    <p>Ocean Protocol : Ocean Protocol is a Data Exchange platform and us being the Oracle Platform can consume Ocean Protocol as a Producer to get the relevant and required inputs. PolkaDossier is not a competitor but can act as a consumer to Ocean Protocol if needed. The data received from Ocean Protocol can be used for further processing and refining in PolkaDossier.</p>
